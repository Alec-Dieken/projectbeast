INTRODUCTION
------------

https://projectbeast.io is a Flask-based web application designed for managing projects, groups, users, and tasks.


HOW TO USE
----------

Create an account by registering with a personal email, or by using one of the social media login buttons. If registering with a personal email, you will receive a link in your email that will validate your account before you can login.

Once logged in, you can immediately create groups, look up other users and send them peer invites, or edit your account.
To edit your profile image, click on the image on your account page, which will show a file upload form. Choose the image you want to upload (must be .png, .jpg, or .jpeg) and click upload image. Image data is uploaded, cropped (using content detection AI), and resized by Tinify's free API account (https://tinypng.com/developers)

Groups are located on the far-right navigation menu. Groups will contain all your projects and tasks.
